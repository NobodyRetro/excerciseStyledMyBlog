        <h2 ><strong>Everyone has a story to tell.</strong></h2>
        <p >Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share insightful perspectives,<br> 
          useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the world—without building a mailing list or a following first. <br>
          The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, <br>
          and helps you find the right audience for whatever you have to say. <br>
          <br>
          We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or discourage us. <br>
          In a world where the most sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards depth, <br>
          nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
              <span class="purpose"><strong><i>Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of the 
                world through the power of writing.</i></strong></span><br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many <br>
          aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. <br>
          They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned that <br>
          the rest of us might want to know <too class="br"></too>
          <br>
          Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of Medium members who align with our mission. <br>
          If you’re new here, start exploring. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn something new, or <br>
          reconsider something familiar—and then share your own story.</p><br>
